## Artificial Neural Network Project - ANN

This project started by following this tutorial to build, test and train a model for the mnist dataset  
[Java Neural Network Tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MMonOWGe0M&list=PLpcNcOt2pg8k_YsrMjSwVdy3GX-rc_ZgN)  

Project contains three applications for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built in Java:  

1. A console application for training and serializing the model.
2. A JavaFX application for drawing numbers, saving training data, and running inference against the serialized model.
3. A console application for shaping data. Augmenting a dataset of images, and splitting the set for training, validation, test  
 

### Features

- **Training and Serialization:** Train your ANN model and save it for future use.
- **Retrain** Transfer Learning - Start with parameters from a saved model to train new model.
- **JavaFX Interface:** Draw and save numbers to create training data, and run inference on the saved model.
- **Early Stopping and Checkpointing:** Monitor validation loss and stop training when necessary, with model saving at appropriate points.
- **Data Augmentation and Splitting:** Generate synthetic data and split it into training, validation, and test sets using the ShapeData console app.
